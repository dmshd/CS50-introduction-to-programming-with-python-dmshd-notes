SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1)

SyntaxError : problem with the code you typed.

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'CAT'

try except else!


TODO : Use while in my prompt inputs

return is stronger than break
it will break out of the loop AND return the value set

try is a statement.

pass

try statements is pythonic
ah, let's try and handle the errors
while others programming languages may use is_numeric, chekck out efore all, if, if if, else, if,...


raise allows you to raise exception youself
