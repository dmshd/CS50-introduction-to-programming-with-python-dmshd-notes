I just needed to access my notes remotely so I created this repo, and it produces activity on my GitHub.

The course is Harvard CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python – Full University Course (https://youtu.be/nLRL_NcnK-4) made available by Harvard on https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp. [Dr. David J. Malan](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/) teaches this course.
